\subsection{Definition of the Living Wage Gap}

\subsection{Purpose of Project}

Extend this model for 2004 - 2014, determine if there are any trends in distribution of the living wage, as well as any trends based on race.

%In this work, I intend on examining the major factors that contribute towards the establishment of flameless oxidation:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Obtain a ratio of chemical to kinetic times scales that is close to unity.
%  \item Enlarge the combustion volume by manipulating fuel-air injection geometry.
%  \item Reducing $O_2$ concentration by 1) vitiate 2)flue gas recirculation.
%  \item Enhance fuel-air mixing with pre-heating amd injection geometry.
%\end{itemize}

%\section{Objectives}
%The objectives of this work are multiple and are listed below:
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Select and validate a chemical mechanism for methane combustion.
%  \item Experimental validation of the chosen chemical mechanism.
%  \item Numerical investigation of different fuel-injection geometry schemes
%  \item Numerical investigation of the effect of $H_2 O$ vitiate on methane combustion
%  \item Numerical investigation of the effect of pre-heating inlet air
%\end{enumerate}
