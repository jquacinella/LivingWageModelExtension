%************************************************

This section will start to look at the living wage gap. First, we will come up with two definitions for the living wage gap, one based on the median wage, and one defined by the minimum wage. After that, we will look at distributions of both definitions. Finally, we will look at the distribution of households who earn the living wage or below.
