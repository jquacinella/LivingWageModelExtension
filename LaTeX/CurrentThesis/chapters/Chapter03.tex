This section will describe each model variable, and link to a section of code in the appendix describing how its loaded.

\section{Housing Costs}

Most Populous Counties

\section{Food Costs}

What is USDA Food Plan, what its used for, link to code section in appendix

\section{Child Care Cost}

Currently, we are only looking at households that contain a single adult. Therefore, we do not model the costs of raising a child. One reason why this was done is that the data source for Child Care only goes back to 2006. Expanding on this work would find data for 2004 and 2005, and model the living wage for different family configurations.

\section{Transportation Costs}

\section{Health Care Costs}

\section{Other Costs}

\section{Taxes}

\subsection{Payroll taxes}

\subsection{State Taxes}

\subsection{Federal Income Tax Rate}

\section{Final DataFrame}

The final data frame, that includes each individual model variable as well as the total living wage \('total_cost'\), with a row for each county per year, is created in section bleh. This DataFrame is used by the following sections of analysis.
