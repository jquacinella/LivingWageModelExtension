    "\n",
    "I'm interested in how to model how bad / false information travels through social media, and if there is any way to categorize conversations into 'rumorous' or 'non-rumorous'. There are two projects, Truthy and Pheme, that are working in this general area. I need to read more of their research, but this paper sparked my interest (http://www.pheme.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ai4cities-rumours.pdf), specifically:\n",

    "> In order to create social media rumour datasets, we propose an alternative way of manually annotating rumours by \n",
    "> reading through the timeline of tweets related to an event and selecting stories that meet the characteristics of a \n",
    "> rumour ... The creation of both rumour and non-rumour datasets will allow us to train machine learning classifiers to \n",
    "> assist with the identification of rumours in new events, by distinguishing the characteristics of threads that spark \n",
    "> conversation from rumour-bearing ones\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm hoping to get a hold of their manually annotated data to see if I can use the features of the tweets to detect rumor bearing convos via a machine learning model. I'd also like to look to see:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * if features regarding any links in the tweets help the model accuracy (article title + text, article topic, article source, etc)\n",
    "  * if features regarding the metadata of the twitter users in the convo (can we use an api to find bot users? low quality tweets for some definition of quality?)\n"
