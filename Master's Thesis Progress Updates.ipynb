    "Most costs acorss counties in NY state seem to be the same, with the biggest county level changes coming from housing. As a matter of fact, looks like *only* housing changes. This means the living wage model does come up with a county-level approximation, but most of the variables are state or national level averages with housing being the only true county-data. In some instances, regional differences are accounted for, like food.\n",

    "Working on the thesis a litle, but didn't have much time. Did some reserch on methodology and realized I can make a simplifying assumption. The model calculates living wages for 12 different sets of families, based on the number of adults and children. Since each of the 12 combinations is a linear combination of adult and child costs from the model, and I am looking for trends and correlations, I will only calculate numbers based on a single adult. This has the side benefit of removing a variable from the model, child care costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also looked over the methodology for the food cost variable, and the logic is simple: food costs are taken from the second chepatest meal in the USDA outline, and are taken to represent a national average. Each county takes this national average and is weighed by a regional factor."
