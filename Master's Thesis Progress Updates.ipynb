    "Working on the thesis a litle, but didn't have much time. Did some reserch on methodology and realized I can make a simplifying assumption. The model calculates living wages for 12 different sets of families, based on the number of adults and children. Since each of the 12 combinations is a linear combination of adult and child costs from the model, and I am looking for trends and correlations, I will only calculate numbers based on a single adult. This has the side benefit of removing a variable from the model, child care costs.\n",

    "I also looked over the methodology for the food cost variable, and the logic is simple: food costs are taken from the second chepatest meal in the USDA outline, and are taken to represent a national average. Each county takes this national average and is weighed by a regional factor."
